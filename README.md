# FastAPI PG starting template

As the name suggests, this is a starting template. A very minimal implementation of FastAPI with PostgreSql.

## To install dependencies

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## To run the application locally

`uvicorn app.main:app --reload`

## Important notes

- This is a starting template
- Very minimal implementation of authentication with JWT token, and slight intro to roles
- Very minimal Dockerfile and docker-compose files

## Mentions

This whole starting template wouldn't be possible without the exceptional documentation and easy approach that [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)

If you're looking to dive deeper and build on top of this template, make sure to read their documentation as it offers great examples

None of this code is entirely mine, I based everything on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sOvCWFmrtA&t=26670s) and added a few tweaks based on [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) documentation

**Feel free to clone or commit any improvements** the entire purpose of this repo is to streamline project generationg
